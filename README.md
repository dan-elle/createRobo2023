# This repository contains all of the projects from CREATE Robo 2023.

## Summary of projects:
### Water Pump (.hex)
Using Micro:bit, students created automated water pumps that kept plants alive all week.

### Morse code LEDs:
Display "Hello" on LEDs using Morse code in Arduino. Students were shown this as an example and then given the opportunity to create their own displays

### Traffic Light LEDS:
Using three LEDS and an Arduino, students simulated traffic lights that were later used for their final design project.

### LED and Microphone:
Students used multiple LEDS and a microphone, with an Arduino, to create a visual display of sound, similar to an audio spectrum visualizer. The louder the sound created was, the more lights turned on.
